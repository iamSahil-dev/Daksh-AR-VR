# EduARtisan - DAKSH Horizon Skills

An AI + AR-powered, offline-first skill development ecosystem that transforms any smartphone into a virtual skill laboratory for vocational education in India.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

India's vocational education system faces a deep-rooted accessibility crisis. Millions of students in rural and semi-urban regions lack exposure to practical, hands-on training due to:
- Absence of physical labs
- Limited internet access
- Shortage of trained instructors
- English-centric e-learning platforms that fail to engage low-literacy learners

Existing e-learning solutions are heavily internet-dependent and fail to prepare youth for the evolving demands of Industry 4.0.

## 💡 Solution: EduARtisan

An AI + AR-powered, offline-first skill development ecosystem that transforms any smartphone into a virtual skill laboratory. Learners can practice industrial operations such as motor assembly, solar panel wiring, or machine maintenance through 3D AR modules, guided by a voice-enabled AI tutor in regional languages.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Adaptive AR Learning** - Real-time AI feedback personalizes training difficulty
- **Multilingual Voice Guidance** - Teaches through regional language voice commands for inclusivity
- **Offline Edge AI** - All modules function without internet; data syncs automatically when online
- **Reality Sync Mode** - AR overlays guide users on real machinery, bridging virtual and real learning
- **Community Skill Network** - Gamified certification system that motivates and connects learners

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Components**: shadcn-ui + Tailwind CSS
- **3D/AR**: Three.js + React Three Fiber
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod
- **Routing**: React Router DOM

### Planned Tech Stack for Full Implementation

- Unity + ARCore for AR simulation
- TensorFlow Lite for AI feedback
- Whisper/Vosk for speech recognition
- Flutter/Firebase for app and storage

## 🎯 Impact & Scalability

This solution can democratize vocational education by reducing infrastructure costs by over 90%, requiring only a smartphone and minimal data. The solution aligns with national initiatives like:
- Skill India
- Atal Tinkering Labs
- Digital India

By enabling offline, multilingual, and interactive learning, it can empower millions of students in resource-limited environments, bridging the skill divide between rural and urban India.

The model's scalability lies in its modular architecture — allowing new modules to be added easily by educators or institutions. With partnerships across ITIs, schools, and NGOs, this educational solution can train India's next generation of innovators and makers by 2047.
